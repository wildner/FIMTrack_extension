## What is this repository for?

FIMTrack is a larval tracking program to acquire locomotion trajectories
and conformation information of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. It is
optimized for FIM images. FIM is an acronym for FTIR-based Imaging Method,
whereby FTIR is the short form for Frustrated Total Internal Reflection.

## Building FIMTrack

First download [QCustomPlot](http://www.qcustomplot.com/) (ver. 1.3.2) and place the header file `qcustomplot.h` and the source files `qcustomplot.cpp` in the `Utility` folder of FIMTrack.

### Linux
These are instructions for Ubuntu/Debian systems, the packages should be similar on other distributions.

#### Dependencies
        sudo apt-get install git libopencv-dev qt5-default g++

#### Building
        git clone https://github.com/i-git/FIMTrack.git FIMTrack
        cd FIMTrack
        qmake FIMTrack.pro
        make
        cd build/release/bin
        ./FIMTrack

### OS X El Capitan 10.11 and Yosemite 10.10
We suggest to use Xcode and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for building FIMTrack on Mac OS X.

#### Dependencies
* Git
    * `sudo brew install git`
* OpenCV
    * `sudo brew tap homebrew/science`
    * `sudo brew install opencv --c++11`
* Qt
    * `sudo brew tap homebrew/versions`
    * `sudo brew install qt5`
    * `sudo brew link --force qt5`

#### Building
        git clone https://github.com/i-git/FIMTrack.git FIMTrack
        cd FIMTrack
        qmake FIMTrack.pro
        make
        cd build/release/bin
        ./FIMTrack
